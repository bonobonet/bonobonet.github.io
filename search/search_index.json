Configuring unrealircd unrealircd will need to be configured for this piece of software to work. This is because OpenBNET requires a UNIX domain socket to connect to over which the IRC daemon provides the needed global state information. Installing the module We must first install the module such that the shared object file .so (the plugin) becomes available for the IRC daemon to dynamically link in at runtime whenever it appears in the configuration file (seen in the next step): To do this you will need to be in your unrealircd source directory where the unrealircd binary is present, then run: ./unrealircd module install third/wwwstats Configuring the module We must now configure both unrealircd to know that the module is available, this is done with the following line: /* Load the module into unreal */ loadmodule \"third/wwwstats\"; And then we must configure the module itself: /* * Support for OpenBNET */ wwwstats { socket-path \"/tmp/openbnet.sock\"; }; It is important that the loadmodule call is done first before using the wwwstats block. Configuring OpenBNET This is taken directly from the OpenBNET GitHub repository . Setting up You will need the following and can install them easily: python3 flask pip apt install python3 python3-pip pip3 install flask You will need to configure the third/wwwstats module as well, information on doing so can be found here . Usage Firstly grab all the files in this repository, then: chmod +x obnet.py The next thing to do will be to set the following environment variables: OPENBNET_BIND_ADDR The addresses to listen on (for the web server) OPENBNET_BIND_PORT The port to listen on (for the web server) UNREAL_SOCKET_PATH This is the path to the unrealircd third/wwwstats UNIX domain socket You can then run it like such: OPENBNET_BIND_ADDR=\"::\" OPENBNET_BIND_PORT=8081 UNREAL_SOCKET_PATH=/tmp/openbnet.sock ./obnet.py Systemd-unit There is an example systemd unit file included in the repository as openbnet.service Custom branding You can adjust the branding in obnet.py by taking a look at the following: # Network information NET_INFO = { \"networkName\" : \"OpenBonobo\" , \"description\" : \"Network statistics for the BonoboNET network\" , \"networkLogo\" : \"open_bnet_banner.png\" , }","title":"Openbnet"},{"location":"openbnet/#openbnet","text":"OpenBNET is a lightweight daemon that runs a web server that provides an API endpoint for getting information about the global BonoboNET IRC network as well as providing a cute little status page regarding this information.","title":"OpenBNET"},{"location":"openbnet/#configuring-unrealircd","text":"unrealircd will need to be configured for this piece of software to work.

It aims to recap all the accomplishments of the past year along wit some notable events as well! Looking back Stability If we go back all the way to when I, deavmi , founded BNET way back when in 2020 round about April I believe, we were in a way different position to now than we were then. This was a period of major instability for the network. We were still running ngircd which still has a good place in my heart but we needed space to grow and some had suggested unrealircd which would be the server software we are using today. Back then we also had rather unstable peers. I recall a user by the name of kaotisk , now old users of BNET will recall that this was a Greek man that was going through some hard times from what I last remember. He, however, had the bright idea to run a node, that we gladly accepted to peer with have you, from his laptop. Little did we know this laptop was not a make shift fixed machine but a machine he would \"DJay with\" and \"Take to the beach\" . Needless to say, we now only peer with people who will have a relatively stable network or atleast will not be experimenting with their host by running routef whenever it suites them. Along with this, the internet connection for lockdown.bnet has been upgraded to 100mbit doown and 50mbit up therefore improving stability from the previous 10mbit line which was nowhere near that since it is a residential network. CRXN also benefitted form this upgrade which means that peering for nodes such as lockdown.bnet and reddawn648.bnet (which both peer over CRXN) is improved. IRC services We never had IRC services back in the original BonoboNET IRC network which ran on NGIRCD, however I believe near the end of NGIRCD deployment was when rany joined us and started experimenting with running IRC services via Atheme , we quickly decided that using unrealircd would be better. Having services has greatly improved the professionalism of the network and given the operators the ability to enforce the policies (the Rules ) that we are mandated to. Lokinet sucesses The deployment of Lokinet for both server peering and client access has been a fun experience especially seeing that it is most likely one of the newest networks out there in this space (Yggdrasil, CJDNS etc.). The former however (client access) has lead to a rather large number of new users, many returning whilst others stopped by. The spike is most likely due to gayballs.bnet 's server attracting a lot of new users due to this being the server operated by the lead developer of Lokinet, secondly because the main Lokinet developer channel now seems to be hosted on BonoboNET as #lokinet . This is obviously a great win for the network and we loom forward to welcoming many more users to the network over Lokinet! Peering We have also updated the peering system such that people can more easily peer. rany has setup a base configuration hosted on Yggdrasil that node operators can pull from (and cache locally) such that the common configuration never needs to be setup again, however along with this peering only requires adding a peer to your side and to the central config (then all other machines can potentially peer with you if you choose to connect with them). New website The new website, which is finally on Github and open to pull requests, is nearing completion and finally looks professional. I think a lot of this has helped new users easily find us. In terms of I2P I recall a user mentioning \"I stumbled across it whilst browsing I2P\" which probably means it was easy enough to navigate - although not to forget that we do have a little advertisement block on the i2pd homepage at i2pd.i2p . Botty We cannot forget our great bot written by rany , botty !

After building unrealircd you should have a sub-directory named conf/ , you should create a new blank file named unrealircd.conf within it. If a file with such name already exists then you will need to delete it and create an empty one form scratch. You are to add the following lines of code in the order that they appear in this tutorial. Default modules There should be some configuration files created for you by the build process, and they should be included by pasting the following into your config: /* Load modules */ include \"modules.default.conf\"; include \"modules.optional.conf\"; include \"snomasks.default.conf\"; include \"operclass.default.conf\"; Cloaking module A cloaking module needs to be loaded, I have decided to use the cloak_md5 module, which can be loaded by placing this directive in your config file: /* Need to use _some_ cloaking module */ loadmodule \"cloak_md5\"; Remote inclusion This section used to be applicable but we no longer do remote inclusion anumore and prefer having the server administrators have their configuration files all based locally. Server information You will now personalize the settings of this server by setting the name of your server to the one you chose in the e-mail. Along with this a custom short description of your server, followed by the sid you were sent in the e-mail. /* IRC node information */ me { name \"<server name>.bnet\"; info \"<short description>\"; sid <sid>; } Following this we will want to add some contact information for your server which will allow a user of your server to find contact information for your server. /* Administrator contact information */ admin { \"<full name>\"; \"<screen name>\"; \"<email address>\"; } Classes We need to define some classes which are effectively names used to refer to a bunch of settings pertaining to connection management in terms of queueing. We shall define these for: clients Affects ordinary clients opers Affects those logged in as oper servers Affects communication for server-to-server (S2S) links These are defined in order below: /* Client class */ class clients { pingfreq 90; maxclients 1000; sendq 200k; recvq 8000; }; /* Oper class */ class opers { pingfreq 90; maxclients 50; sendq 1M; recvq 8000; }; /* Server class */ class servers { pingfreq 60; connfreq 30; maxclients 100; sendq 20M; }; Operator information Since this is your server you will be able to configure an operator account that can only be used to gained privileged control over your server. You should set the nickname for your operator user and put that in <username> . Also, set a strong password that will be used for gaining access to operator status. /* * Operator information */ oper <username> { class opers; mask *@*; password \"<operator password>\"; operclass netadmin; swhois \"is a Network Administrator\"; vhost administrator.bnet; } It is important you keep the vhost set as administrator.bnet Listening configuration We now need to configure what ports your server will listen on. Clients For client connections we will let the server bind to all addresses and listen on port 6667 : /* Client (plaintext) */ listen { ip *; port 6667; } We will also have a socket listen on 6697 which has TLS enabled on it such that users can connect ina secure manner if they so choose to: /* Client (TLS) */ listen { ip *; port 6697; options { tls; } } Lastly we need to create an allow {} block. With listeners setup a socket is bound which will accept connections at a network transport protocol level however once connected we can decide whether to let someone proceed with sending us IRC commands, allow blocks control this. We want to let any user in from any IP (hence the *@* ), we want it to apply rules from the clients class defined earlier and only allow a maximum of a 100 connections from the same IP: /* * Allow blocks */ allow { ip *@*; class clients; maxperip 100; } Servers The servers need to be able to link to each other and they do so over TLS, so add the following: /* Server (TLS) */ listen { ip *; port 6900; options { tls; serversonly; } } Services configuration There are some restraints we need to include some configuration to allow a certain server, namely services.bnet , to be able to have special rights seeing as it provides IRC services to the whole network. We also add another rules banning the use of nicknames that are used for services. /* Give special rights to the IRC services */ ulines { services.bnet; } TODO: the above should be added into remote config? Server parametrs There are some parameters that are specific to your server which are required to be set, these are shown below: k-line address The k-line address is the e-mail address a user should use in order to get in contact with the admin of a server regarding a k-line they received on said server. This is set as follows: /* k-line address */ set { kline-address \"<admin email address>\"; } Set the <admin email address> here to the same one you used in the admin {} block earlier Unchanging parameters The following settings should be set as is. They control the modes a user will have set in certain scenarios, what modes a channel will have when created also which channel operators (such as you) should join to. /* Modes and oper auto-join */ set { modes-on-connect \"+ixw\"; modes-on-oper \"+xws\"; modes-on-join \"+nt\"; oper-auto-join \"#opers\"; options { hide-ulines; show-connect-info; } } Spam protection The following settings relate to controlling potential spam-like activity on your server. set { /* Minimum connection time before valid use of `/QUIT` */ anti-spam-quit-message-time 10s; /* Settings for spam filter */ spamfilter { ban-time 1d; /* default duration of a *LINE ban set by spamfilter */ ban-reason \"Spam/Advertising\"; /* default reason */ virus-help-channel \"#help\"; /* channel to use for 'viruschan' action */ /* except \"#help\"; channel to exempt from Spamfilter */ } } The first option is anti-spam-quit-message-time This is to be set to the number of seconds that someone must be connected before using the /quit command If the user uses the command below the bound then it is considered spammy and they will be marked as spammy users We recommend the default of 10s (10 seconds) The spamfilter block includes some more in-depth parameters relating to spam We normally don't change any of the settings here and leave them as is Restrictions One can configure the restriction of commands in a time-based manner using tje restrict-commands option as shown below. set { restrict-commands { list { connect-delay 60; exempt-identified yes; exempt-reputation-score 24; } invite { connect-delay 120; exempt-identified yes; exempt-reputation-score 24; } } } We normally leave these settings as is. Connection throttling One can configure the throttling of connections with the connthrottle option as shown below. set { connthrottle { known-users { minimum-reputation-score 24; sasl-bypass yes; } disabled-when { reputation-gathering 1w; start-delay 3m; } } } We normally leave these settings as is. Maximum channels You can configure how many channels a single user may be a member of with this parameter: /* Maximum number of channels a user can be a member of */ set { maxchannelsperuser <number>; } Set <number> to a positive number It is recommended you make this reasonably large enough; nobody wants to join a server where they cannot maintain multiple channel memberships 100 is a good number yolo /* * Misc. */ drpass { restart \"restart\"; die \"die\"; } TODO: Do this Logging One can configure where logs are to be sent to along with the verbosity of said logs: log { source { all; !debug; } destination { syslog; } } The source block defines the filter for logs We recommend logging all - everything but excluding debugging prints (hence the !debug ) We almost always suggest have the destination be syslog as that is where one is most likely to look in the event of any errors Links The last thing you will place in your configuration file is an inclusion for a new file that will be created when you move onto the Linking section, therefore add the following: /* Links */ include \"links.conf\"; Network configuration This section configures the server's network information: set { network-name \"BonoboNET\"; default-server \"rany.bnet\"; services-server \"services.bnet\"; sasl-server \"services.bnet\"; stats-server \"stats.example.org\"; help-channel \"#help\"; hiddenhost-prefix \"cloaked\"; prefix-quit \"Quit\"; } There is nothing here which you should change. Cloak keys The cloak keys are required to be the same on all server's participating in the BonoboNET IRC network: set { cloak-keys { \"<key1>\"; \"<key2>\"; \"<key3>\"; } } You must fill in the keys <key1> , <key2> and <key3> You can get these keys once you have applied for a server link by following the prior steps Nickname restrictions Taking into account the fact that BonoboNET is an IRC network that uses IRC services there are some names which should not be available as nicknames for the average user as they are indicative of IRC services, this section places a restriction such that nobody can /nick as any of these. /* Don't allow ChanServ to be used */ ban nick { mask \"*C*h*a*n*S*e*r*v*\"; reason \"Reserved for Services\"; } /* Don't allow NickServ to be used */ ban nick { mask \"*N*i*c*k*S*e*r*v*\"; reason \"Reserved for Services\"; } /* Don't allow HostServ to be used */ ban nick { mask \"*H*o*s*t*S*e*r*v*\"; reason \"Reserved for Services\"; } /* Don't allow MemoServ to be used */ ban nick { mask \"*M*e*m*o*S*e*r*v*\"; reason \"Reserved for Services\"; } You should next check out how one can setup monitoring of the node itself with OpenBNET monitoring","title":"Daemon"},{"location":"network/config/daemon/#configuration","text":"This will provide you the steps in configuring your unrealircd server to be able to link into the BonoboNET IRC network.
